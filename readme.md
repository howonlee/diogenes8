Diogenes mark 8
===

Set email url, password with envvars

You have to set:

```
DIO_SMTP_URL
DIO_SMTP_PORT
DIO_SMTP_USERNAME
DIO_SMTP_PASSWORD
DIO_DEST_EMAIL
```

Use an app password for the `DIO_SMTP_PASSWORD`

Diogenes mark 1 was some paper
mark 2 was a web app (that I took down, because it was getting annoying)
mark 3 was a spreadsheet
mark 4 was a local postgres DB
mark 5 was a static site with JS that I took down
mark 6 was some paper
mark 7 was a SQLite local crud command line app, threw that away
You're looking at mark 8, the filesystem local crud command line app

Overall goal is to create pip installable dealio
